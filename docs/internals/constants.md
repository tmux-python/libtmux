# Internal Constants - `libtmux._internal.constants`

:::{warning}
Be careful with these! These constants are private, internal as they're **not** covered by version policies. They can break or be removed between minor versions!

If you need a data structure here made public or stabilized please [file an issue](https://github.com/tmux-python/libtmux/issues).
